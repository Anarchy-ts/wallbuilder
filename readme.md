# INTRO :
Hey,
I am Tamoghna Saha, a student doing B.tech in IIT Madras. 
I have alway been interested in robotics. Being in a competition team here I had learnt a lot of ROS and gazebo but I had implemented
them only on wheeled robots. 
i enjoyed doing this assignment. Implementing ros2 controllers on a robotic arm was a fun and learning experience for me. 
I put all of my efforts and managed to do this much in two days. My exams start from day after tomorrow so I will need to put my focus there also.
Hence, I have submitted early even though the deadline is till 6th May.
Thank You.
